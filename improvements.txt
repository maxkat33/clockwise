- reference time displayed and able to drop-down for date, time and location?
- intitial load of user location takes a little while, not sure why at this stage.
- save preset location set ups and name them 
- change dropdown of reftime to be highlighted
- make it visually obvious you can change location and time manually
remove speicifc clock
smooth animations
nice background blur
